## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Challenge:
1. Data collection effort when learning from scratch, narrow generalization
2. Training a unified control policy in robot
3. Restrictive to the input observations, not general to the public

### 1.2 Contributions:
* A system for pretraining generalist robot policies more suitable for the diversity of interfaces in downstream robotic applications.
## 2. Method
